## Usage

* Install dependencies:
  
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

* Run locally (debug):
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

* Deploy to github-pages: should be done automatically on pushing to the repo thanks to the [`deploy workflow`](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

  To do it manually, run:

    ```sh
    npm run deploy
    ```
